# Assignment 01

## Step 01: Use `curl` to download a page

Very easy assignment, but I have learned something new about executable permission in linux. `chmod` means **change mode**, `+x` means **add executable permission**. I have learned saving output using `-o filename.ext` earlier in the colemak setup.

## Step 02: Use `fetch` to download a page

Node `fetch` api to download html and `fs` package to save it in a file.

## Step 03: Use `curl` with `execa`

This was new to me. First time to use `execa`. Running bash command in nodejs. Nice!!!

## Step 04: Parse the file with `jsdom`

I might not use `jsdom` earlier. Creating a query-able dom tree from html string, sheii!!

## Step 05: Parse the file with `puppeteer`

Rendering html file in puppeteer and parsing data from there was new from there. A new learning.
